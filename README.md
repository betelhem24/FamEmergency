# FamEmergency

**FamEmergency** is a real-time **"safety heartbeat"** that makes sure you're never alone in a crisis. It uses **WebSockets and GPS** to act as a digital **Guardian**, automatically alerting family or nearby help if you don’t check in or if an emergency is triggered. I’m building this because when **seconds count**, having your location and **medical info** instantly in the hands of rescuers can literally be the difference between **life and death**. I am justifying this project because current emergency systems are **reactive**, and we need a **proactive tool** that bridges the **"information gap"** by sharing life-saving data before it's too late.
