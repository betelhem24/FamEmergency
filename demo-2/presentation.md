**"Safety should never be a solo journey."**
FamEmergency is a proactive, real-time safety network designed to close the "Information Gap" during life-critical emergencies.

---

### Slide 2: The Problem: Every Second Counts
*   Emergency Response is often **reactive**, not proactive.
*   Paramedics lack access to vital **medical history** on arrival.
*   Family members often experience the **"Where are they?" panic** during crises.
*   **Our Solution**: A real-time, bi-directional safety heartbeat.

---

### Slide 3: Triage Command Center (For Professionals)

### Slide 5: SOS & The Guardian Timer
![SOS View](sos.png)
*   **Pan-Global Broadcast**: One tap alerts your entire network via WebSockets.
*   **Guardian Timer**: A "dead-man's switch" that automatically triggers help if you don't check back after a solo activity.
*   **Live Event Pipe**: The server maintains a constant connection to ensure the SOS signal *never* fails.

---

### Slide 6: The Full-Stack Muscle
*   **Frontend**: React 18 & TypeScript (Reliability first).
*   **UI/UX**: Glassmorphism Design with Framer Motion animations.
*   **Real-time Engine**: Socket.io for millisecond-latency alerts.
*   **Database**: Dual-DB Strategy (PostgreSQL for records, MongoDB for social).
*   **Security**: JWT Session tokens and bcrypt password encryption.

---

### Slide 7: Why FamEmergency?

2.  **Peace of Mind**: Families stay connected through low-latency GPS.
